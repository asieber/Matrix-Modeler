# Matrix-Modeler

NOTE: This project is still heavily under construction. Most basic matrix operations are, however, functional.

Models matrices as objects in Java and supports an array of matrix operations including, but not limited to: right multiplication, computing the determinant, reducing to reduced row echelon form, computing the inverse, computing the eigenvalues and (soon) diagonalization.
